the extra feature I added was the ability to scale and offset the texture using variables stored in the material and then sent to the shader

FINAL ASSIGNMENT:
the effect I created was a cel shader that uses a ramp texture to shade objects in a cartoony style. 3 Examples of cel shaded objects are given with a variety of different textures, normal maps, and roughness values.
