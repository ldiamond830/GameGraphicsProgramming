my feature for the final project was screen space ambient occlusion, at the moment does not use IBL for physically based ambient but some of the infrastucture
for adding IBL is included as I might work on that over the summer

my five extra features where, color lerping, position lerping, adding and independent transform to the emitter, alpha cutout, and sprite sheet animations
